# COVID-19-Case-Prediction
# 🦠 COVID-19 Case Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to **forecast future COVID-19 cases** using historical time-series data from the **Johns Hopkins University** dataset. By applying regression techniques like **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression**, the model predicts upcoming case trends and visualizes them for better understanding.

## 📊 Objective

> **Create a time-series prediction model to forecast future COVID-19 cases using historical data. Apply regression techniques and visualize trends.**
